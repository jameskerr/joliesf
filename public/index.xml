      <description>About Jolie Jolie SF was dreamt up with the desire to celebrate people every day. As dessert consultants we help dream and source products for your business needs. We hope to make this process as sweet as the products we source.
Jolie (Jo-Lee) is a French word meaning “pretty.” While in France, Vanessa’s limited French speaking skills allowed her only a handful of phrases and words and she found herself saying “tres jolie” (very pretty) probably more often than appropriate, but we think her enjoyment made up for it.</description>
