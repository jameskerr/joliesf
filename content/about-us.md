## About Jolie

Jolie SF was dreamt up with the desire to celebrate people every day.
As dessert consultants we help dream and source products for your business needs. We hope to make this process as sweet as the products we source.

Jolie (Jo-Lee) is a French word meaning “pretty.” While in France, Vanessa’s limited French speaking skills allowed her only a handful of phrases and words and she found herself saying “tres jolie” (very pretty) probably more often than appropriate, but we think her enjoyment made up for it.

## About Vanessa
Vanessa is a Bay Area local who grew up in Cupertino, CA. After graduating from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo with a degree in Business Marketing she decided food was her ultimate calling and pursued a degree in Culinary Arts from The Culinary Institute of America at Greystone. An externship brought her to Rennes, France where she worked at the Michelin star restaurant La Fontaine aux Perles performing many duties including making traditional French desserts. She came back and dove into work for Revolution Foods in Oakland, CA, traveling the U.S. training chefs on new menus and helping the R&D chef with new food for kid lunches. With a strong desire to get back into making more delicious and sugary things she landed in the Absinthe pastry kitchen under Chef Bill Corbett. It was here where she honed her pastry skills and began to dream up Jolie SF. Vanessa has always loved making people feel special and baking is one of her favorite ways to do that.
